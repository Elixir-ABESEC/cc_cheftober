# Dislike of Threes

Polycarp doesn't like integers that are divisible by `3` or end with the digit `3` in their decimal representation. Integers that meet both conditions are disliked by Polycarp, too.

Polycarp starts to write out the positive (greater than 0) integers which he likes: `1`,`2`,`4`,`5`,`7`,`8`,`10`,`11`,`14`,`16`,…. Output the k-th element of this sequence (the elements are numbered from 1).

### Input
The first line contains one integer t (1≤t≤100) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

Each test case consists of one line containing one integer k (1≤k≤1000).

`Example`
<pre>
10
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
1000
</pre>

### Output
For each test case, output in a separate line one integer x — the k-th element of the sequence that was written out by Polycarp.
