# Dijkstra's algorithm

The algorithm exists in many variants. **Dijkstra's** original algorithm found the shortest path between two given nodes,[6] but a more common variant fixes a single node as the "source" node and finds shortest paths from the source to all other nodes in the graph, producing a shortest-path tree.
