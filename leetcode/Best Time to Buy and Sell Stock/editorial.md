## Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

## Example
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Output: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

## Brute Force
We need to find out the maximum difference (which will be the maximum profit) between two numbers in the given array. 
Also, the second number (selling price) must be larger than the first one (buying price).
